      <description>Introduction First, what is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization technology that allows running isolated applications in containers.
Containers package applications along with their dependencies and libraries, making it easy to deploy and run them. With Docker, you can execute various versions of Linux distributions, applications, and services like web servers, databases, and programming languages.
